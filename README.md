Sinhala, a challenging and a complex language when it comes to spelling and grammar correction presents unique challenges in developing effective tools for spell and grammar checking. This project explores a comprehensive approach to address these challenges by combining traditional methods with modern machine learning techniques.
For spell checking, we utilized a 

1.Dictionary-based approach 

where words were cross-referenced with a predefined dictionary file. 
Suggestions for corrections were then generated by analyzing the likelihood of word matches, ensuring accuracy and relevance to the intended context.

2.RAG based approach 
For grammar checking, we experimented with three distinct approaches:

1.	A rule-based method focused on validating sentence structures against the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern, a common grammatical format in Sinhala.
2.	An LSTM-based model, leveraging sequential learning to identify and correct grammatical inconsistencies.
3.	A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application, which integrates retrieval mechanisms with generative models to provide more contextual and adaptive grammar correction.
4.	
By integrating these methods, this Sinhala language spell and grammar checker aims to provide robust and reliable assistance for linguistic accuracy.
